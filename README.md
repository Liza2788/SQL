# Welcome to Elizabeth's SQL Portfolio!

ðŸ‘‹ **Hello and thanks for dropping by!** I'm Elizabeth, a budding data analyst currently diving deep into the world of SQL through the **Break Into Tech Data Analytics Certificate Course** led by Charlotte Chaze. This repository is a curated collection of my SQL projects, reflecting both my learning journey and my growing expertise in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## What's Inside?

- **SQL Scripts**: Dive into the scripts to see the raw SQL queries I've crafted. From basic data selection and aggregation to more complex joins and subqueries, you'll find a variety of techniques that address real-world data challenges.

- **Analysis Insights**: Where applicable, I've included insights and conclusions drawn from the data. These highlight my ability to not only manipulate data but also derive meaningful insights from it.

## Why This Portfolio?

This portfolio serves as a testament to my commitment to mastering SQL and data analytics. It's designed for fellow learners, potential employers, and anyone interested in data analysis. Whether you're here to evaluate my skills, find inspiration for your own projects, or just curious about SQL, I hope you find this repository informative and engaging.

## Let's Connect!

I'm always on the lookout for feedback, opportunities for collaboration, or just a good data-related chat. Feel free to reach out to me here on GitHub.
