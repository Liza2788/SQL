#This is the first project I did 
#For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store and their prices. 

#Use a SELECT statement to order the items by price.
SELECT *
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price desc;

#Show a statistic about the item prices.
SELECT SUM (price)
FROM superstore;

SELECT AVG (price)
FROM superstore;

SELECT MAX (price)
FROM superstore;

SELECT MIN (price)
FROM superstore;

SELECT SUM (price), category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category;

SELECT AVG (price), category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category;

SELECT MAX(price), category
FROm superstore
GROUP BY category;

SELECT MIN (price), category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category;

SELECT COUNT (price) category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category;

#Show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Appliances". 
SELECT MAX (price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category="Appliances";
